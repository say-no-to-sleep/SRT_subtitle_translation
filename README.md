# SRT_subtitle_translation
Translating subtitle files (SRT) while retaining context

This program splits different chunks of the SRT into sentences, ensuring clear context for translation.

In addition, it splits the translated paragraphs into chunks similar to the original one.

Translation is using [deep_translator](https://github.com/nidhaloff/deep-translator)
