Finally, we add 1 to i once again and it becomes

628
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:59,900
three. 3 is not less than 3 though, it is
equal to 3, and so we donâ€™t enter the loop

629
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:03,990
and it terminates, moving on to the next segment
of code. This is a simple example, but you

630
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:06,830
can extrapolate it across programming to fit
your needs.
