Now, variables have to be one continuous string,

409
00:30:49,249 --> 00:30:53,120
and so if you wanted to make a variable that
stored the player score, you’d have to find

410
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:58,000
some way to combine the words player and score,
since you can’t have the phrase “player

411
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,549
score” be the name of a variable. All programmers
have their own personal preference when it

412
00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:07,570
comes to naming variables, but the one we
will be using on this lecture is called CamelCase,

413
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:11,960
which is the process of not capitalizing the
first word, but capitalizing every word that

414
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:17,919
follows it. Going back to the player score
example, using the camelCase method, the variable

415
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:23,760
would be called playerScore. This allows us
to easily identify each word and becomes really

416
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:31,259
useful for long variable names like thePlayersScoreBeforeFinalBoss”,
whereas if we just type it out without capitalization,

417
00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:38,380
it would be really confusing. This will help
a ton when you start to find bugs in your

418
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:42,789
code and need to quickly scan your program
to figure out whats wrong, and adds to the

419
00:31:42,789 --> 00:31:48,239
overall readability of the program. Other
programmers might use different naming conventions

420
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:53,559
like using underscores to separate the words
in a phrase, but for now we’ll be sticking

421
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:54,789
with camelCase.
