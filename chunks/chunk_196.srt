896
01:06:31,850 --> 01:06:35,790
Now the thing you have to understand is that
when you’re making your own functions, which

897
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:40,660
is something we will be covering soon, you
have to choose what your function will return,

898
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:46,010
if anything at all. Functions are able to
return values back to the user whether they

899
01:06:46,010 --> 01:06:53,150
be String variables, integer variables, or
even arrays. Now the thing to note about returning

900
01:06:53,150 --> 01:06:57,760
values is that calling the function alone
won’t do anything. You have to return the

901
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:04,230
value into something. As an example, the Max
function we talked about previously would

902
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:10,280
return an integer, but in order to do something
with it we would have to either set a new

903
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:15,610
integer variable equal to the result of that
Max function, or we can print out the result

904
01:07:15,610 --> 01:07:19,640
of a function, which in this case would just
print out the maximum value between the two

905
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:24,720
integers. Using functions which return values
don’t do much on their own, you have to

906
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:28,080
pair it with something in order to gain use
out of it.
