You see, we just “call” the print function

833
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:31,070
and enter in what we want to be printed to
the console, and the computer does it for

834
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:35,700
us. Behind the scenes, there is actually even
more complex code that is in charge of taking

835
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:40,890
your text and translating it to the console
to be printed. The developers of almost all

836
01:01:40,890 --> 01:01:45,390
programming languages realize that you don’t
want to program something that manually has

837
01:01:45,390 --> 01:01:49,810
to print something to the console through
the use of complex programming, and so they

838
01:01:49,810 --> 01:01:54,360
implemented the print statement to reduce
the stress and complexity of code on the user,

839
01:01:54,360 --> 01:02:00,820
abstracting it down to a simple line of code.
