String variables can store strings of letters,

308
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,039
which are just words and sentences. Strings
are useful for displaying text and storing

309
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,929
input information. Strings can also be concatenated
together to form combinations of string variables

310
00:23:09,929 --> 00:23:14,159
and prewritten strings. This is very useful
for outputting information in a readable format

311
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,049
for the user. For example, imagine that we
have a string called “name”. The code

312
00:23:18,049 --> 00:23:22,279
asks for input, and stores that string of
text in name. To output this information to

313
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:25,809
the user, rather than simply displaying their
name, you can add the phrase “Your name

314
00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:31,389
is:” and make it into a sentence by concatenating
“Your name is:” + name + “.” This

315
00:23:31,389 --> 00:23:36,049
makes it easier to read your code, while also
adding variability to your code, which always

316
00:23:36,049 --> 00:23:38,820
makes things more interesting for the end
user.
