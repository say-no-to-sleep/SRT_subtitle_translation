00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:35,330
Now letâ€™s run through the loop. We start
with i = 0, 0 is less then 3 so we enter the

624
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:39,610
loop and print out Hello World. Now that the
instructions are done we add 1 to i making

625
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:45,030
it 1. Moving on, 1 in less than 3 again, so
we once again enter the loop and print out

626
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:50,870
Hello World. Again, we add 1 to i, making
it 2 now. 2 is still less than 3 so we enter

627
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:55,380
the loop again and print out hello world.
