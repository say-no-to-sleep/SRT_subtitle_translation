01:41:45,330 --> 01:41:50,880
For those unfamiliar with accounting, LIFO
means last in first out, or the last item

1335
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:56,219
put on the stack will be the first one removed
from it. Essentially, every time you ask your

1336
01:41:56,219 --> 01:42:01,100
computer to complete a task, that task is
added to the stack, and will be the first

1337
01:42:01,100 --> 01:42:06,010
one to be resolved. Think of it like a stack
of stones, you can keep adding stones on top

1338
01:42:06,010 --> 01:42:10,210
of your pile, but in order to get to one near
the bottom, you first have to remove all the

1339
01:42:10,210 --> 01:42:14,781
rocks on top of it. Now when your function
continually calls itself without end; without

1340
01:42:14,781 --> 01:42:20,760
a base case, like in our infinite loop example
then the stack will never be resolved, as

1341
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:25,620
items will be continually added to the stack
without any of them ever being completed.
