Some have different styles that may seem odd,
some may make you use abstract or weird concepts

116
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:44,700
which may be confusing, and like all languages,
programming languages have a set of rules

117
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,400
that you must follow when writing code in
that language, and at the forefront of those

118
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:54,970
rules is grammar. Programming grammar is referred
to as syntax and is very similar to real-world

119
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:59,150
grammar. Each programming language has its
own syntax, or rules, that you have to follow

120
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:04,720
to a tee if you want your program to run correctly,
just as if you were speaking in real life.
