00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:29,269
Another cool thing you can do with variables
is add them, subtract them, multiply them,

393
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:32,880
divide them, and even modulus them. Now this
mostly only works for integer variables as

394
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,929
multiplying and dividing strings doesn’t
make too much sense. But if you were making

395
00:29:33,929 --> 00:29:39,102
a calculator app and you stored the first
number the user entered as num1, and the second

396
00:29:39,102 --> 00:29:45,140
as num2. You could then multiply num1 and
num2 together, and either print them, or store

397
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:50,759
them in a new variable entitled result. Then,
each time you run the program, the user could

398
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:55,990
input new numbers into the num1 and num2 variables,
and they would simply be set to those new

399
00:29:55,990 --> 00:30:02,860
integers and return the result that corresponds
to those specific numbers. This allows for

400
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:07,029
you to keep easy track of which numbers are
which and what’s going on in your program

401
00:30:07,029 --> 00:30:12,509
which is extremely useful. Also, while you
cannot subtract, multiply, divide, or take

402
00:30:12,509 --> 00:30:19,590
the modulus of strings, you are able to add
them. Let’s say you had a string Str1 with

403
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:26,029
the contents “Hello “ and a Str2 with
the contents “there”. You could add Str1

404
00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:31,269
and Str2 to create a string that had the contents
“Hello there”, either storing it in a

405
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:34,500
third variable or printing it out to the console.
