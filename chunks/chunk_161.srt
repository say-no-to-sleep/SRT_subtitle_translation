Oftentimes, for syntax and runtime errors
the IDE will print an error message out to

741
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:59,799
the console. See what line or lines it points
to- since those will be the lines in which

742
00:54:59,799 --> 00:55:05,150
the error occurred- and see if you can understand
and fix what it says the problem is. If the

743
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:09,100
error isn’t clear, or you’ve never heard
of it, then try googling it, there are many

744
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:13,010
websites out there such as stackoverflow which
serve as forums to ask and answer problems

745
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:18,020
with code. Chances are, if you’ve had a
problem, someone else has had the same issue

746
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:23,261
and there is likely a tested solution. Usually,
when a syntax or runtime error pops up, you

747
00:55:23,261 --> 00:55:28,560
should be able to find a fix for it fairly
easily; however, as I said before, the issue

748
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:32,980
may arise from some loophole or oversight
in the code you hadn’t planned for beforehand.
