00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:25,380
So as a review, we check the initial if statement,
if it’s good we run all code within that

467
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:29,380
if statement’s curly brackets and move on
with our program, if the initial if statement

468
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:33,740
is NOT true, we then move on to any else if
statement’s and evaluate if THOSE conditional

469
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:37,640
statements are true. We can have as many else
if statements as we want, although this could

470
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,970
lead to clutter amongst your code so we’ll
talk about some alternatives later on to help

471
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:44,840
this out. Now that takes care of the if-else
statement, so now we’ll move on to the else

472
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,500
statement.
