An array is, as you may have guessed by now,
a list. You can have an array of integers,

522
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,630
an array of strings, and even an array of
other arrays which is something weâ€™ll cover

523
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:08,980
in a minute. Programmers use arrays when they
want to store a lot of variables containing

524
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:13,700
information that is all related to each other,
such as a grocery list or a high score list

525
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:18,880
in a game. Think of arrays as a column in
excel or google sheets. You have the title

526
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,950
at the top and then below it are a bunch of
bits of information which all relate to the

527
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:27,510
title. Arrays are super useful when programmers
want to store a lot of information that can

528
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:31,410
be easily searched through because programmers
have developed methods of breaking down and

529
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:36,600
using arrays to find specific information
in arrays full of thousands of different variables.
