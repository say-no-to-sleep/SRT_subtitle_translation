452
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:27,330
This is a hard concept to wrap heads around
so let’s do an example. If we had a program

453
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:32,169
that evaluated the if statement if (age = 10),
we could then have a statement under that

454
00:34:32,169 --> 00:34:38,120
which stated else if (age = 12). Now, if the
age variable was 10, which we can see from

455
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:42,120
the example it is, then the code immediately
following that conditional statement in the

456
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:46,040
brackets would run. The else if statement
we made would not even be tested since we

457
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,970
know it is going to be false, and thus the
print statement inside of THAT conditional

458
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:54,230
statement’s brackets will be ignored, and
the code will move on to the rest of the program.
