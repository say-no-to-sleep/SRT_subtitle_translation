513
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:22,950
For example, let’s say you’re making an
app which allows users to create a grocery

514
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:28,510
list. Well there’s no real easy way to create
lists using variables, because it's not like

515
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:34,050
you can have one variable store the names
of 7 or 8 different food items. Remember,

516
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:39,100
we can only put one piece of paper in our
cardboard box; no more. And besides, even

517
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:43,740
if you were to add multiple items to one string
variable, you still would have a lot of trouble

518
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:48,540
doing simple tasks you might want from a list
like searching through it or splitting it

519
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:52,360
or even deleting items from the list when
you’re done with them. This is the problem

520
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,680
that using arrays solves for us.
