The second type of error we will be covering
is the runtime error. These errors don’t

698
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:49,641
show until you actually “run” the code,
hence the name “runtime” error. Runtime

699
00:51:49,641 --> 00:51:54,310
errors are caused by a statement in your code
that SEEMS seems logically sound, but the

700
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:59,690
computer physically has no way of computing
it in a reasonable amount of time. The most

701
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:03,780
common of these errors is one which we’ve
already talked about; the infinite loop. As

702
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:08,820
a refresher/example, think of an infinite
loop like this. Say you sat your friend down

703
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:13,200
in front of the TV, put on the Office on repeat,
and told him he could leave as soon as Michael

704
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,870
made a “That’s what she said” joke.
