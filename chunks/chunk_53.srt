Now while we could just make a string that

240
00:17:44,269 --> 00:17:48,549
says that exact phrase and print it out to
the console, in some cases it would be more

241
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:52,590
useful to print out the actual integer value,
especially in the case of a game where the

242
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:57,149
score can change each time you play, because
score definitely isn’t always going to be

243
00:17:57,149 --> 00:18:03,039
4. Well, we’re also able to print multiple
strings of text, and even integers by “adding”

244
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:08,499
them together in the print statement. This
is called concatenation.
