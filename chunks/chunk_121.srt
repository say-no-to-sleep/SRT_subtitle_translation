This is great for when we want to access elements

559
00:41:50,850 --> 00:42:00,081
in the array because we can do so instantaneously,
but the one downside is that we can’t increase

560
00:42:00,081 --> 00:42:05,950
the size of the array later on, all array
sizes are final. Think of it like setting

561
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:11,560
up a bookshelf with books. By populating a
bookshelf with a certain number of books and

562
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:15,780
then moving on and filling the next shelf
with different books. We have no way to go

563
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:20,690
BACK and add books to that first shelf without
shifting everything. Once we decide how much

564
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:25,540
space to dedicate space for an array in this
case, there’s no way to ADD more space.
