841
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:11,701
This is actually the main theme of all functions
and the backbone of any good program. Oftentimes

842
01:02:11,701 --> 01:02:15,840
in your program there are going to be sections
of code which are repeated and serve the same

843
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:21,100
purpose, or equations which you want to allow
differing inputs of. And so you can use functions

844
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:26,080
in order to condense these down into singular
lines of code to save both time and reduce

845
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:31,520
clutter on your code. As you will see soon,
functions are EXTREMELY powerful and will

846
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:36,960
definitely be something you utilize all the
time in your computer science journey.
