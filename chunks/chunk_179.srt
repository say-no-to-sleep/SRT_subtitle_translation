823
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:39,930
Now, you may not know it, but we’ve actually
been talking about a few functions this entire

824
01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:46,780
series. Print statements, for loops, and even
basic math operations are all examples of

825
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:51,610
functions, which of course begs the question
of what actually defines a function. Well,

826
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:56,610
a function is a segment of code that can be
easily run “calling” the function name

827
01:00:56,610 --> 01:01:01,060
and depending on the type of function, will
do something in return. Functions can be called

828
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:07,140
numerous times, and in numerous places. Essentially
they are like wrapping up a segment of code

829
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:12,380
into a nice present and giving it a name which;
when called, will unwrap the present and go

830
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:15,460
through the code you wrapped up.
