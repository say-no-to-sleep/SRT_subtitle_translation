A program may also rely on factors that will

331
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,190
change as the program progresses, in which
case a variable is once again required. Also,

332
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:43,400
taking these variables and manipulating them
is quite necessary for carrying out many of

333
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,129
the tasks you want a program to carry out,
for instance multiplying int variables or

334
00:24:47,129 --> 00:24:52,111
concatenating string variables. Overall variables
are the backbone of any good program and youâ€™ll

335
00:24:52,111 --> 00:24:56,279
find yourself using them often if you want
clean and efficient code, so it's best that

336
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:59,179
you learn what types of variables you need
to use and when.
