An infinite loop occurs when you give a for

634
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:21,710
loop a condition which will always be met
given the parameters of the program, and so

635
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:26,360
the software crashes. For example, a for loop
beginning at 10 and checking if i is ever

636
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:29,971
less than 0, and then adding 1 to i at the
end of the loop will never terminate, since

637
00:47:29,971 --> 00:47:32,900
i will just increase infinitely.
