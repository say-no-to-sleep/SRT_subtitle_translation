130
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,140
As an example. If we wanted to do something
simple such as initialize a variable, which

131
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:51,620
is something we haven’t covered yet but
the example is still relevant. In java, you’ll

132
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:56,410
notice we have to specify what type of variable
we are defining in this case an integer, and

133
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:00,650
also add a semi-colon after the statement.
