And now comes the new part. Inside the parenthesis,

1037
01:17:37,770 --> 01:17:43,530
you define which type of variables you want
to pass in as arguments, in this case an integer,

1038
01:17:43,530 --> 01:17:48,210
and then a name for that variable. This name
is what you will use to refer to the integer

1039
01:17:48,210 --> 01:17:54,000
the user passed in. For this example let’s
just call it num1. Then if we want to add

1040
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,570
another argument, we simply add a comma in
between the two and we can make another integer

1041
01:17:58,570 --> 01:18:03,840
variable num2 to hold the second number. We
could do this for however many variables we

1042
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:08,190
want to pass into the function, but for now
let’s close off the parenthesis and just

1043
01:18:08,190 --> 01:18:14,280
print the product of num1 and num2. As you
can see, we refer to the two numbers the user

1044
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:19,720
will input to the function as num1 and num2.
