Another thing to note really quickly is that
you can actually make a variable without putting

353
00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:22,999
information inside of it. This would be like
if you built up a new cardboard box, gave

354
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:27,629
it a label with a sharpie, but just didn’t
put information inside of it. You’re simply

355
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:33,759
saving that space in your warehouse for later.
