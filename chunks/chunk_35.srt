157
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:49,530
That covers the basic gist of syntax and programming
rules, so now that we know HOW to write code,

158
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:53,590
and WHERE to write code, we next need to cover
what happens after we have typed out our program

159
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:57,370
and run our code. Because writing a piece
of code for a game or for a database is cool

160
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:01,500
and all, but after the computer interprets
the program, how will we know whatâ€™s happening,

161
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:06,290
and whether it is working or not? Well, programmers
do this by looking at the console. The console

162
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:10,320
is a text interface within the computer that
us programmers can use for a variety of different

163
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,881
purposes. If you remember, a short while ago
we showed a picture of a basic IDE, and one

164
00:12:15,881 --> 00:12:18,800
of the main parts of that picture was the
console.
