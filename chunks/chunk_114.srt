As an example to show just how useful arrays
are, let's say you’re a startup company

531
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:45,660
that owns an app that has 100,000 users. Every
time a user wants to create a new account,

532
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:48,920
they input the username they want and then
your program will have to check to make sure

533
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,060
the account name hasn’t already been taken.
