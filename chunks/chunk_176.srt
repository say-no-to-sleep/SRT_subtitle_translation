Anything that is designated as a comment will

791
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:29,060
not be read by the program as code, and will
be skipped over. Essentially, it becomes something

792
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:34,150
that is only there for YOU the programmer
to read. The syntax varies from language to

793
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:37,790
language, but it usually involves placing
some symbols before or around the code you

794
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:41,630
would like to be commented. Examples of how
to comment in different languages can be seen

795
00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:46,930
on the screen now. Also, when you comment
something, the IDE will grayscale the line

796
00:58:46,930 --> 00:58:51,991
of code, making it extremely easy to determine
what’s commented and what is not. Commenting

797
00:58:51,991 --> 00:58:56,460
code ‘deletes’ it in the computer’s
eyes without actually deleting it. If a problem

798
00:58:56,460 --> 00:59:00,880
is present before you comment a section of
code but it is gone afterward, then that section

799
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,810
of code is the culprit. If you comment part
of a code out and there are still issues,

800
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:09,400
then move onto another section until you find
the culprit. Once you do, you can tweak it

801
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:14,000
until it works as intended or delete it entirely
and you will have a fully functioning program

802
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,580
once again. Hurrah!

803
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:19,202
Now that we’ve talked about what to do IF
you’ve encountered an error and a strategy

804
00:59:19,202 --> 00:59:23,190
on how to find and fix it, I’d like to talk
about some strategies you can use to AVOID

805
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:28,070
errors in the first place. Firstly, backup
your code frequently. In the event of the

806
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:31,770
code completely bugging out and you being
unable to fix it, you will want the ability

807
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:35,980
to revert to a previous version where the
code was still working. If you save frequently

808
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:40,630
enough, then you will probably not lose too
much work. Version managers like Github or

809
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:45,261
Subversion can help with this, as they backup
code to an online cloud service in which you

810
00:59:45,261 --> 00:59:48,950
can easily pull previous versions of the program
at any point.
