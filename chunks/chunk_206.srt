931
01:09:26,150 --> 01:09:31,730
However, if you had created a printStats()
function like we did a little while ago, all

932
01:09:31,730 --> 01:09:36,339
you would need to do is find where you defined
that function and add in a print statement

933
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:42,020
which displays the new statistic and you’re
done, bam. Now, every place which had called

934
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:47,060
the printStats function previously will now
also print the new statistic as well. You

935
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:51,850
can see how powerful functions can be if used
properly, and we haven’t even scratched

936
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:53,420
the surface yet.
