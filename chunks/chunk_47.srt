00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:15,110
This includes addition, subtraction, multiplication,
and division, all of which are represented

209
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:19,490
by the symbols shown on the screen now. In
any IDE that you may install, you’ll be

210
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:23,310
able to print out the answer to simple math
problems using the print statement, which

211
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:26,900
may seem counter-intuitive because why would
you use the computer to do math when you have

212
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:31,360
a perfectly good calculator on your phone,
but you have to remember that computers are

213
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,820
dumb, and anything we want a computer to do
we have to build up from scratch. Basic arithmetic,

214
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:42,260
while simple, helps out in almost any program
you may write. For example, if we wanted to

215
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:46,630
build a basic calculator app, we’d need
to utilize this functionality in order to

216
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:52,150
correctly display the answer to an arithmetic
problem when our user tries to add, subtract,

217
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,690
multiply, or divide two numbers.
