776
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:25,410
Upon the breakpoint being reached, the program
will pause, and wait for you to continue it

777
00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:28,880
through a button press. This signals that
the spot in the code where the breakpoint

778
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:34,220
was placed, in this case the correct conditional
path, has been reached by the program. You

779
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:38,230
can then continue the program knowing that
was or wasnâ€™t where an error in your code

780
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:42,510
occurred. Breakpoints can be used in conjunction
with print statements in order to both pause

781
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:46,890
the program, and perhaps view the values of
your variables at the moment in time to give

782
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:50,610
yourself all the information you could want.
