1031
01:17:08,370 --> 01:17:12,420
Remember the parenthesis that I mentioned
like 30 seconds ago, well we put any variables

1032
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:17,610
we want the user to pass into the function
into these parenthesis, and then when we “call”

1033
01:17:17,610 --> 01:17:22,791
that specific function, it will be required
to have those variables passed into it. For

1034
01:17:22,791 --> 01:17:26,980
example, in Java, let’s make a function
that takes in 2 numbers and prints out the

1035
01:17:26,980 --> 01:17:32,360
product of those numbers. We start with the
public void plus name of function setup since

1036
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:37,770
again, we won’t be returning any values.
