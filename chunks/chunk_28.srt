These can be things such as how you type out
certain functions, what you put at the end

122
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,590
of a line of code, and how you set up certain
functions. Each language is unique in its

123
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:18,120
syntax, and while some may share similar rules,
all will have some quirk which makes it stand

124
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,880
out from the rest. Syntax is something that
catches a lot of people off guard, since many

125
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,050
expect every programming language to follow
the same set of rules, but as we spoke about

126
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:31,700
in the last segment, because each language
is specialized for a specific task, each needs

127
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,930
its own set of rules to function. Breaking
or disregarding these rules will result in

128
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:41,840
an error, just how breaking or disregarding
rules in real life will result in an unintended

129
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,160
message.
