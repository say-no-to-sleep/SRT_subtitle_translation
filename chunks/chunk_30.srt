In python, we donâ€™t even need to define

134
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:05,360
that we are trying to create a variable and
just have to type what we want to create,

135
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,271
and in javascript, we just specify we are
making a variable, but do not include what

136
00:10:09,271 --> 00:10:15,270
type of variable we want to make. Even in
this simple example you can see how much syntax

137
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:19,070
matters when learning a new language since
while the goal of our program remained the

138
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:25,480
same, define an integer with value three,
all the programming language shown took different

139
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,240
approaches. All these languages require that
you follow this syntax because remember, computers

140
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,520
are extremely dumb, if you forget one semicolon
or misplace a character, the entire program

141
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,240
will not run and send you back a syntax error,
which is something we will talk about later.
