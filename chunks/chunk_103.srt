480
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,531
Now remember back to the fact that we can
have thousands of else if statements, after

481
00:36:17,531 --> 00:36:21,170
a while that can get pretty cluttered, and
so another very useful conditional statement

482
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:24,700
which helps circumnavigate this problem is
the switch statement. A switch statement is

483
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,730
functionally similar to many if and else if
statements together. You write a switch statement

484
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:32,250
in the form of switch (variable), and then
below that you write how many cases that the

485
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:36,080
variable could be. For instance, if we wrote
switch(var), then under it we could write

486
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,890
out 5 cases that the variable var could be,
and then the instructions listed under that

487
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:43,990
case to be carried out if the var variable
is equal to that case.
