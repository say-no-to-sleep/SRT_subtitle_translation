Searching algorithms at their core are ways

1168
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:52,040
in which we can look through a list of values
stored in an array, say a patient name list

1169
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:57,590
or a high score list, and find a particular
piece of data. The goal of a searching algorithm

1170
01:27:57,590 --> 01:28:02,300
is to simply give the algorithm a string or
object you want it to find and return the

1171
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:07,880
index of the array that contains that string
or object as fast as possible. Now this may

1172
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:11,750
seem simple, but lots of software runs on
the backbone of being able to search through

1173
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:17,300
lists extremely quickly, making searching
algorithms, and in particular efficient searching

1174
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:22,520
algorithms, an important topic to cover. Additionally,
this is the main functionality that arrays

1175
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:27,390
are used for and is the backbone of many of
the methods used with arrayLists as well as

1176
01:28:27,390 --> 01:28:32,450
many other storage methods, so knowing them
will take you a very long way.
