In addition to providing a place for programmers
to develop their code, IDE’s provide some

98
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:23,590
extremely useful tools for programmers to
ease the job of writing code, such as built-in

99
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:27,550
error checking because as we’ll talk about
later; code doesn’t always run correctly,

100
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:31,909
auto-fill in for frequently used words or
phrases, and project hierarchy which will

101
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:36,539
help you organize and manipulate the files
within your project. Back in the olden-days,

102
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:40,349
before IDE’s, code used to be written on
punch cards and then fed into computers which

103
00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:45,569
would take hours and cause a lot of pain.
