00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,240
Inside the print statement we start off by
printing the string “Game over, “. Now

251
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:44,549
here comes the important part, from there,
we use a plus sign and add 4 to the print

252
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:48,779
statement, just like if you were adding two
numbers. Then, we can repeat this process

253
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:54,090
with another + sign for the final string “ was
your final score” and we’re able to print

254
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:59,029
out the entirety of our statement easily.
