1045
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:29,400
Now, whenever we want to call the multiplyNumbers
function, we just have to make sure that we

1046
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:34,570
are putting 2 numbers in as arguments. In
this case the number 5 becomes num1, and the

1047
01:18:34,570 --> 01:18:39,880
number 8 becomes num2. From there we simply
run the code and the number 40 is printed

1048
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:44,590
to the console. It’s important to note that
you can also mix and match variables when

1049
01:18:44,590 --> 01:18:50,500
making arguments. So you can have someFunction
which takes in a char, an integer, and two

1050
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:54,140
strings all within one function. Pretty neat
in my opinion. The last thing I want to mention

1051
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:58,780
about arguments is that when you call a function
you have to follow the variables you defined

1052
01:18:58,780 --> 01:19:03,680
when making the function. So for our multiplyNumbers
function you couldn’t put in a string and

1053
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:08,400
then an int. It HAS to be two integers because
that’s what the computer is expecting to

1054
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:11,310
be passed into the function.
