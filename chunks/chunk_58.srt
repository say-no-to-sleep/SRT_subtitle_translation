256
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:08,070
We could also combine the two lessons we’ve
learned thus far and do something like “Game

257
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:14,369
over, “ + (4+4) + “ was your final score”,
in the case lets say where we have a game

258
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:19,860
which gives you a base score, then 4 points
for a certain task you completed. This demonstration

259
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:24,640
also displays another important part of programming,
which is that oftentimes to get your program

260
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,720
to be the most efficient, you have to combine
aspects of code.
