Another small thing I want to touch upon really
quickly is that when you initialize an array,

573
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:07,550
you must determine which type of array it
is right then and there. For example you have

574
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:12,310
to specifically say it will be an array of
strings or integers when defining it, and

575
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:16,060
also you’re not allowed to mix and match,
meaning you can’t have an array full of

576
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:20,430
integers with a few strings and some doubles
thrown into the mix. They have to be all the

577
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:21,430
same type.
