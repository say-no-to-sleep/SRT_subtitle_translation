If you would like to read all of the elements
in an array and compare them to some value,

642
00:47:54,250 --> 00:48:00,270
or perform some operation on them, a for each
loop is extremely useful. So for example,

643
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:04,280
we could have a for each loop which iterated
across an array and simply printed out the

644
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:07,780
value of each array location.
