686
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:53,210
This can be anything, from forgetting a semicolon
at the end of a statement in java, accidentally

687
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:57,340
defining a variable with two words instead
of one, or even just misspelling the word

688
00:50:57,340 --> 00:51:01,940
String when you’re trying to define a string
variable. Lucky for you guys, these errors

689
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:06,200
are extremely easy to fix since you just need
to figure out where the error occurred and

690
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:11,420
what the syntax rule you broke was. Now thinking
back to IDE’s, we mentioned that IDE’s

691
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:16,580
are so useful because they do precisely that,
they underline syntax errors and usually provide

692
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:21,490
helpful hints as to how to fix them. Think
of syntax errors as small misspellings or

693
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:26,690
grammatical errors in an essay you’re writing,
annoying; yes, but not the most infuriating

694
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:31,560
things. Another useful thing about IDE’s
when it comes to syntax errors is that the

695
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:36,320
program will actually restrict you from running
the code unless all syntax errors are cleared,

696
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:40,430
making them even easier to identify and fix.
