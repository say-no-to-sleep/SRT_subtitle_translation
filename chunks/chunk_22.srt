IDE’s provide a graphic interface on your

92
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:58,529
computer in which the programmer can easily
write, run, and debug code without having

93
00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:03,110
to worry about problems with compilation or
interpretation of the program. Think of an

94
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:07,189
IDE as any other program on your computer
such as a game, a browser, or even the file

95
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:11,619
explorer, except we’ll be using it to write
code. IDE’s are able to turn your code into

96
00:07:11,619 --> 00:07:15,289
machine code and run it through the computer
to produce results.
