261
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,200
Now it's important to note that the computer
will take whatever you put in parenthesis

262
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,590
and print it out character for character,
so oftentimes programmers will forget to add

263
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:41,049
a space onto the end of their strings. This
can result in an small mistake in which the

264
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:44,179
string from the previous example will be printed
out as if to say

265
00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:48,690
“Game over,4was your final score” which
isn’t that appeasing when displayed on screen

266
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:53,999
to the user, so it's good practice to always
put a space after and before your strings

267
00:19:53,999 --> 00:19:58,240
to make sure this doesn’t happen, and your
string doesn’t end up like this.
