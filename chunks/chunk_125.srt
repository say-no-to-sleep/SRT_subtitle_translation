If you make an array of arrays it's referred

580
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:35,290
to as a 2D, or 2 dimensional array. Think
of these as matrices if any of you have taken

581
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:40,200
algebra classes. Now If you havenâ€™t, think
back to our google sheets example but instead

582
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:45,830
of just columns, we would add rows as well.
