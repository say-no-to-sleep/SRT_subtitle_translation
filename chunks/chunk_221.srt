Functions that do and don’t return values
and functions that both do and don’t take

1000
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:42,540
in arguments. For creating your own functions,
we’re just going to go down the list and

1001
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:47,690
talk about how to approach creating them,
starting with the most basic of the bunch,

1002
01:14:47,690 --> 01:14:53,670
one which takes no arguments and returns no
values, but before we start that, there are

1003
01:14:53,670 --> 01:14:58,690
a few small things I want to note about function
naming conventions. The variable naming conventions

1004
01:14:58,690 --> 01:15:03,440
we talked about previously also translate
over to function names. So you can’t have

1005
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:08,611
two word functions and you can’t use special
characters like periods or commas. Generally

1006
01:15:08,611 --> 01:15:12,400
you’re going to want to follow the same
camelCase style which we talked about in the

1007
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:16,340
variables video.
