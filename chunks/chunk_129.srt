Well as you could probably tell by that statement
right there, a programming loop is a statement

598
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:53,540
that is used to run certain instructions repeatedly,
just like how the opening statement of this

599
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:58,880
topic was repeated 5 times. Loops are very
useful for a variety of reasons. For instance,

600
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,670
imagine you want to print something 15 times.
