203
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,061
So now that we know a whole bunch of information
about programming languages and how and where

204
00:14:52,061 --> 00:14:56,420
to write them, along with the print statement
under our belts, let’s go over some intuitive

205
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,810
things the computer can do all by itself,
without you having to tell it how to. More

206
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:05,910
specifically, we’ll be covering basic number
mathematics as well as string math

207
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:10,310
Starting off with basic mathematics, the computer
already knows how to do simple arithmetic.
