615
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:03,440
Eventually, when the integer has been modified
by either increasing or decreasing it to the

616
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,860
point where it no longer meets the condition,
the for loop will terminate and the code will

617
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:10,760
continue to run. For example, let’s say
our integer value was i and we set it equal

618
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:15,330
to 0, then we set the conditional statement
as i being less than 3, so basically we’re

619
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:19,670
saying that as long as i - the variable we
just created - is less than 3, continue running

620
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:24,390
the instructions contained within the loop.
