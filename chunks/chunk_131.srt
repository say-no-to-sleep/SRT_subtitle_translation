Now what if instead of rewriting the same

603
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:14,280
instructions over and over again, you could
simply place the print statement inside of

604
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:18,010
a loop, and it will occur as many times as
you would like, that’s the power of loops

605
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:22,490
baby. With loops we’re able to repeat parts
of code multiple times. Now there are three

606
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:27,510
different types of loops that we will be discussing
today. And up first is the for loop.
