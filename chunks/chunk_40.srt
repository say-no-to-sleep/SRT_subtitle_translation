00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,040
this calculation, instruct the computer to
print the output of the program to the console,

182
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,690
and upon the programâ€™s completion, 7 will
appear on the console. As you can see, the

00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:34,879
console allows us to easily print information
out to the developer for a variety of uses.
