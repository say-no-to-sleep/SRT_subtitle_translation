473
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,320
The else statement once again comes after
an if or an else if statement, and will carry

474
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,790
out its instructions no matter what, as long
as the preceding statement/statements are

475
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:59,660
evaluated as false. If we went back to our
previous program, we could add an else statement

476
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:03,080
which would only have the code in its brackets
run if the age variable wasn’t “10”

477
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:07,180
or “12”. This would catch all cases of
the program that didn’t fit our parameters.
