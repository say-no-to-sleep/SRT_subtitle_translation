972
01:12:35,110 --> 01:12:39,060
It would be a waste of computing power to
import the entire library, and would increase

973
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:43,850
the load time for your program. For smaller
programs, this isn’t a big deal, but it

974
01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:48,041
really starts to add up when dealing with
larger projects. Therefore, you would instead

975
01:12:48,041 --> 01:12:55,210
use “from math import factorial” or the
java equivalent “import java.math.factorial”,

976
01:12:55,210 --> 01:12:59,489
and now have access to that one math command
only. This limits the functions that you can

977
01:12:59,489 --> 01:13:03,960
use, however it saves programming runtime.
