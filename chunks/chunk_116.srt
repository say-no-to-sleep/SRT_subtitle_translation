00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,280
Now the single most important thing to note
about arrays is how you reference each element

538
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:16,470
of the array within them. Let’s create a
basic array called numbers, and inside of

539
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:22,420
it put the digits 1-10. Now when we want to
refer to each cell in this array, we call

540
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:27,140
upon its “index”. An index is just a fancy
way of saying that numbers are placed within

541
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:32,730
the array. Now you would think that the first
integer in this array would be the first index,

542
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:37,920
the second would be the second index and so
on, but that’s not the case. In computer

543
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:43,450
science, programming languages refer to the
first cell as the 0th element in the array.
