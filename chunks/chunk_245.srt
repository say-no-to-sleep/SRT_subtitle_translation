Imagine you have a dictionary of prices at

1148
01:26:27,230 --> 01:26:31,670
a store where the key is the name of the product
and the value is the price of the item. Maybe

1149
01:26:31,670 --> 01:26:36,790
apples cost 1 dollars, milk costs 2 dollars,
and bread costs 3 dollars. You can see that

1150
01:26:36,790 --> 01:26:41,520
in the dictionary, each key is the name of
a product, and each key corresponds to the

1151
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:45,590
price of each product. So to find the price
of bread, all you need to do is simply call

1152
01:26:45,590 --> 01:26:48,390
the dictionary using the key “bread”,
and the dictionary would return the value

1153
01:26:48,390 --> 01:26:51,960
1. This makes it extremely easy to track values
through your code since you’re working with

1154
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:55,840
tangible values rather than numbers which
don’t mean anything to you.
