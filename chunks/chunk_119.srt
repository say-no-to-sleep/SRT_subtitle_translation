Another extremely important thing to note
about arrays has to do with their size. When

553
00:41:20,891 --> 00:41:25,370
you initialize an array, you can do it either
one of two ways. You can either populate it

554
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:29,610
with the elements that you want contained
in the array right then and there, creating

555
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:34,110
and filling the array at the same time, or
you can define how many elements you want

556
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:40,140
in the array-essentially the arrays size-
and then populate it with elements later.
