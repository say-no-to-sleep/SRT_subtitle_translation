1190
01:29:30,969 --> 01:29:34,860
Now before we jump into different types of
searching algorithms, we must discern between

1191
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:40,430
the two states that arrays or lists can be
in, either sorted or unsorted. A sorted list

1192
01:29:40,430 --> 01:29:45,739
of information is characterized by some sort
of rankable value, whether that be a patient

1193
01:29:45,739 --> 01:29:52,370
ID, credit card number, or even by alphabetical
values like username’s or legal names. An

1194
01:29:52,370 --> 01:29:56,930
unsorted list is just some random assortment
of related information, not sorted by any

1195
01:29:56,930 --> 01:30:02,571
particular order or reason. Some searching
algorithms only work for sorted lists, usually

1196
01:30:02,571 --> 01:30:08,070
the more efficient ones, and some work for
both sorted and unsorted lists, although these

1197
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:11,841
are usually less efficient. If you end up
pursuing computer science further, you will

1198
01:30:11,841 --> 01:30:16,340
have to deal with both sorted and unsorted
lists, so it's good to know common searching

1199
01:30:16,340 --> 01:30:19,239
practices for both

1200
01:30:19,239 --> 01:30:23,111
Another thing to note is that we determine
the efficiency of a searching algorithm based

1201
01:30:23,111 --> 01:30:29,160
on both the worst case scenario and the average
number of items it must search. We call this

1202
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:33,910
Big O notation, in which each searching algorithm
has an equation which takes in the size of

1203
01:30:33,910 --> 01:30:38,989
the array as an integer n, and will output
an worst-case scenario efficiency value that

1204
01:30:38,989 --> 01:30:44,469
we can use to compare with other searching
algorithms. We can then also look at how long;

1205
01:30:44,469 --> 01:30:49,110
on average, it takes to find an element in
a list. Using these two methods allows us

1206
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:54,360
to easily compare how efficient two algorithms
are. Alright, now that we’ve got some background

1207
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:57,900
on searching, let’s hop right into it.
