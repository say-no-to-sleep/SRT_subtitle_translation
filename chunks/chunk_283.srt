So how does this translate to pseudocode?

01:45:04,330 --> 01:45:10,250
Well, think of our family trip to the Grand
Canyon as a program. Programmers use pseudocode,

1378
01:45:10,250 --> 01:45:15,280
pseudo meaning not real, and code meaning,
well, code, as a means to plan out their programs

1379
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:20,900
before they write them, just like how we planned
our trip before going. They throw away syntax

1380
01:45:20,900 --> 01:45:25,630
and naming conventions for variables and just
focus on what they want the program to accomplish,

1381
01:45:25,630 --> 01:45:30,230
and how they plan on doing that. Pseudocode
is very similar to constructing an outline

1382
01:45:30,230 --> 01:45:34,600
for a paper you’re writing. You write down
the main topics of the essay and plan out

1383
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:38,490
your major talking points, but you don’t
worry about the nitty gritty details of it

1384
01:45:38,490 --> 01:45:43,760
all such as word choice, grammar conventions,
and proper formatting. By doing this, we allow

1385
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:48,110
ourselves to think freely and not worry about
stressing the small stuff. At least not yet.
