00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:18,410
For this problem specifically you could place
said print statement before the branch of

761
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:23,010
the conditional that would print the value
of x. Now when you run the program you know

762
00:56:23,010 --> 00:56:27,650
exactly what the computer is thinking. Printing
out the value of x just before the if/else

763
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:30,921
statement will let you know if the variable
has the value you want it to have, and if

764
00:56:30,921 --> 00:56:34,540
it doesn’t you know that somewhere above
that conditional something went wrong and

765
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:39,840
x was set to a value you didn’t want it
to. In this case, x is equal to 2, which is

766
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:42,240
why x is small is being printed out.
