is best for your needs? Well, it depends what

1471
01:52:37,530 --> 01:52:41,840
you are trying to do, as sometimes you need
very specialized languages to get done what

1472
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:47,430

vast and contains many fields, so trying to

1473
01:52:47,430 --> 01:52:51,810
cover everything in one language would be
impossible. This has led to the creation of

1474
01:52:51,810 --> 01:52:56,860
thousands of different programming languages
each designed for a specific task. Right now

1475
01:52:56,860 --> 01:53:01,210

languages and their uses.
