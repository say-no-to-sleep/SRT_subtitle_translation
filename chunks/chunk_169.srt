767
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:46,500
Now we know what the problem is we can track
down where and when in the code we modify

768
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:51,540
x to figure out the problem. Use print statements
to determine where your program goes wrong,

769
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:56,720
and then try to track down the cause of these
issues and solve them. If you use this strategy,

770
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:00,470
make sure you end up deleting the print statements
afterwards to avoid clutter in the console.
