437
00:33:07,249 --> 00:33:12,179
Now, the condition within the parenthesis
can take on thousands of different forms such

438
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:17,840
as if the value the string variable Name is
equal to “Steven” or if the player's score,

439
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:22,460
stored in an int variable, is greater than
5, the list goes on and on. Each of these

440
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:26,779
statements is evaluated as a boolean, which
you will remember from when we talked about

441
00:33:26,779 --> 00:33:32,610
variables is either true or false. If the
boolean is true, we run the code inside the

442
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:38,279
curly braces, if it’s not, we pretend everything
inside the curly braces never existed and

443
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:40,970
move on with our code.
