459
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:59,640
Now, for example, let’s say we changed the
age variable to be 12 instead of 10. Now,

460
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,710
instead of the first conditional statement
being, true, it actually evaluates as false,

461
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:07,400
since age no longer equals 10. So what we
do now, is first skip over the print statement

462
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,690
which prints out that the age is 10, since
it’s not. And now we evaluate the else if

463
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:15,740
statement. We check if age is equal to 12,
which again it does, and so now we run all

464
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:19,750
the code inside of that conditional statement
before finally moving on to the rest of the

465
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,850
program.
