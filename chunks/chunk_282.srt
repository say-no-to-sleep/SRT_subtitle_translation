Think of pseudocode like this, if you wanted
to take a family trip to the grand canyon,

1371
01:44:39,290 --> 01:44:42,910
would you simply hop in your car and drive
off and figure things out later? No, because

1372
01:44:42,910 --> 01:44:48,280
that would be ridiculous. Instead, you would
spend some time planning out the trip, what

1373
01:44:48,280 --> 01:44:52,200
sites or places do you want to visit? What
hotel reservations are you going to have to

1374
01:44:52,200 --> 01:44:56,350
make? What kind of things are you going to
do when you get there? What routes or highways

1375
01:44:56,350 --> 01:45:00,030
are you going to take and why? All of these
things must be determined out before you can

1376
01:45:00,030 --> 01:45:04,330
even think about hopping in your ford explorer.
