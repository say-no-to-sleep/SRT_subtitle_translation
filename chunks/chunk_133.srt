The syntax for a for loop varies depending

609
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:40,780
on the language, however it usually consists
of three parts. An integer value, a condition

610
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:44,460
which the integer value must meet in order
to exit the loop, and an operation to modify

611
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:48,570
the integer value after the instructions inside
of the loop are completed. Each time the for

612
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:52,890
loop runs, the operation you set will be performed
on the integer, and as long as that integer

613
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:56,710
still meets the condition you set, usually
being greater than or less than a constant

614
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:59,450
value, the for loop will continue to run.
