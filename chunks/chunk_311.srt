1514
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:09,420
Starting with the biggest question which is
what’s the next step. Well, now that you

1515
01:56:09,420 --> 01:56:13,760
might know which type of language you might
be interested in, research that language and

1516
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:18,410
find out whether or not you truly want to
pursue that programming language. Most languages

1517
01:56:18,410 --> 01:56:24,590
like python or C++ will have either an official
website where you can read up on, or a wikipedia

1518
01:56:24,590 --> 01:56:28,850
page which will provide you with useful information
in deciding whether or not you want to pursue

1519
01:56:28,850 --> 01:56:33,750
that path. From there, the next step is to
actually learn the language, which can be

1520
01:56:33,750 --> 01:56:38,770
done right here on YouTube. While we have
taught you the basics of any programming language,

1521
01:56:38,770 --> 01:56:43,010
each specific language is going to expand
upon the basic concepts and so watching tutorial

1522
01:56:43,010 --> 01:56:46,000
videos on a certain language is going to be
very beneficial. Many websites will try to

1523
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,000
get you to purchase paid courses or take classes
which cost money, but you can find extremely

1524
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,000
good courses here on YouTube for absolutely
0 cost to yourself. I would start with an

1525
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:51,320
introduction series like the one you’re
currently watching, but for the language you

1526
01:56:51,320 --> 01:56:55,580
have chosen and work your way through that
series, picking up on the syntax and rules

1527
01:56:55,580 --> 01:56:59,920
of that language until you become comfortable
with it.
