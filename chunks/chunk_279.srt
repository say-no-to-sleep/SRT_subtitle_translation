In conclusion, recursion in general is extremely
useful because by calling the same functions

1354
01:43:24,840 --> 01:43:29,541
repeatedly it breaks down the problem into
smaller sections, and results in the program

1355
01:43:29,541 --> 01:43:35,340
being more efficient. Small parts of problems
are easier to solve and less taxing to compute

1356
01:43:35,340 --> 01:43:40,199
than the entire problem at once, and the computer
can combine these small solutions into the

1357
01:43:40,199 --> 01:43:42,910
main solution in the end.
