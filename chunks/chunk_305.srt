Maybe it would be best for you to use a scripting
language. A scripting language is a language

1482
01:53:30,910 --> 01:53:34,610
that has many commands for you to use and
that can also be run without needing to be

1483
01:53:34,610 --> 01:53:39,870
compiled. Scripts can be faster to write than
actual programs, and tend to be easier to

1484
01:53:39,870 --> 01:53:45,640
port between operating systems allowing for
cross-platform support. Scripts can also be

1485
01:53:45,640 --> 01:53:51,340
used with websites, oftentimes adding to the
overall user experience of the site. If you

1486
01:53:51,340 --> 01:53:55,650
want to go into web design, this might also
be a path for you to go down. Examples of

1487
01:53:55,650 --> 01:53:58,370
scripting languages are Perl, PHP, Ajax, and
Javascript.
