From there, if they log into their account
you then want them to have the functionality

1429
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:16,090
to withdraw money, deposit money, take out
a loan, or pay back a loan. If they decide

1430
01:49:16,090 --> 01:49:19,980
to set up a new account, you want them to
be able to create an account, store their

1431
01:49:19,980 --> 01:49:24,070
information in a database, and then access
all of the features that a returning member

1432
01:49:24,070 --> 01:49:29,910
would have. This may look very similar to
the flowchart, the only difference being this

1433
01:49:29,910 --> 01:49:35,699
is abstracted one level higher, over an entire
program rather than just a single function.
