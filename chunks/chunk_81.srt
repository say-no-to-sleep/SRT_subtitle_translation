This is what the computer does, except the

348
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:59,119
storage facility is memory, the box is a variable,
and the contents of the box are whatever the

349
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:04,730
variable is set to be equal to. Any time you
want to know the contents of the name variable,

350
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:09,169
you can simply call it and the computer will
pull the information that is stored in that

351
00:26:09,169 --> 00:26:13,630
variable out and use it how the user sees
fit.
