Now when you’re writing code, you have to
understand that things aren’t always going

674
00:49:55,170 --> 00:49:59,470
to go the way you expected them, and sometimes
the program doesn’t always work as you had

675
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:04,340
intended it to. We programmers call these
errors and while annoying, they are always

676
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:08,290
going to come up in computer science and so
it's best to learn what they are and how to

677
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:13,580
deal with them. Often referred to as “bugs”,
errors in scripting languages can be narrowed

678
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:19,931
down to one of three “types”: syntax,
runtime, and logic, all three of which we

679
00:50:19,931 --> 00:50:22,820
will be covering in today’s video.
