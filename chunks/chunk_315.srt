The next is CoderByte, which offers over 200+

1536
01:57:37,340 --> 01:57:41,400
challenges that you can complete in over 10
different languages, something that is sure

1537
01:57:41,400 --> 01:57:46,110
to help you improve. The final website I’d
like to talk about is hackerRank, which not

1538
01:57:46,110 --> 01:57:50,630
only provides programming challenges to keep
you on your toes, but also provides support

1539
01:57:50,630 --> 01:57:53,550
for using you programming skills to find jobs
or internships, something you’ve probably

1540
01:57:53,550 --> 01:57:55,080
definitely thought about if you are taking
programming up as a skill. These and many

1541
01:57:55,080 --> 01:57:59,660
more websites exist solely to keep you interested
in code and work on refining your skills to

1542
01:57:59,660 --> 01:58:00,850
become better, you just have to find them
because they’re certainly out there.
