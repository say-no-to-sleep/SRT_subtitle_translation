00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:11,330
Next up, we have the while loop. A while loop
will continually carry out its instructions

646
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:14,950
while a conditional statement given to it
is true. This can be as long as a certain

647
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:18,750
variable is true, as long as a number is less
than another number, or while a value is still

648
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:23,260
equal to another value. While loops are different
than for loops in that the loop is not contained

649
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:26,850
within one statement, but stretched out and
will continue to run so long as its condition

650
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:28,290
is true.
