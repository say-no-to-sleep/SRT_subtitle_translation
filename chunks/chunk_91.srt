Next, weâ€™ll be moving on to conditional
statements, which at their core, are statements

423
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:04,049

on certain conditions. For the sake of keeping

424
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:07,659
things simple, for this section, red lines
will connote that our code will NOT be following

425
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:12,860
that specific path, and green lines will mean
that our code IS following that path.
