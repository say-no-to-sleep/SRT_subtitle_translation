A user enters a number, and if this number
is 8, I want the program to return True; however,

1400
01:46:51,570 --> 01:46:56,710
if the number is not 8 then I want to return
false. It’s a great way to visualize what

1401
01:46:56,710 --> 01:47:00,710
the function’s overall purpose is and also
look for any errors that you may have missed

1402
01:47:00,710 --> 01:47:06,080
when thinking about the function, such as
a missing path. It also abstracts the programming

1403
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:11,290
statements up to simple blocks, making it
easier to modify or change completely. The

1404
01:47:11,290 --> 01:47:16,010
best part is, that when you have finished
testing cases you can simply convert the blocks

1405
01:47:16,010 --> 01:47:21,540
into statements and you have a well-written
function without any debugging.
