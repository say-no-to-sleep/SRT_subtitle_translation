00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,559
To start, let's go over what happens when
we define a variable. Now when we write a

341
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:21,929
line of code which initializes a variable,
and that code is executed, the computer essentially

342
00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:26,489
creates a little space in memory that stores
your variable name and its contents so that

343
00:25:26,489 --> 00:25:32,350
it can be referenced later. Going back to
our cardboard box example. Think of this as

344
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:37,749
if you have a storage facility, and you make
a new cardboard box, labeled “Name” and

345
00:25:37,749 --> 00:25:42,230
inside of it you put a piece of paper with
the word “NullPointerException” on it.
