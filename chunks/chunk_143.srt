Like a for loop, you can make the condition
such that it will eventually return false

652
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:35,230
and exit the loop, however while loops will
not crash your computer should you create

653
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:40,290
an infinite loop. In fact, it is very common
for while loops to run infinitely, as, for

654
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:43,770
certain programs, you would like the program
to continually be iterated through instead

655
00:48:43,770 --> 00:48:47,430
of running once, all the way through until
you exit out of the program.
