For example, in the sentence “let’s eat,

144
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:53,070
grandma”. If you were to forget that comma,
while it may seem like a small mistake, it

145
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:56,460
changes the entire context of the sentence,
making it sound like you’re about to eat

146
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:02,320
your grandma. The same rules follow for programming,
if you forget a semicolon, the entire context

147
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,950
of your program could be corrupted and misinterpreted.
