01:19:18,630 --> 01:19:23,420
Now the main difference between defining functions
that return variables and defining ones that

1058
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:29,060
do not is that in some cases you have to specify
that you want this function to return an integer

1059
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:34,100
variable, this is most commonly used in Java,
where you would replace “void” with “int”

1060
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:38,210
to tell the computer that you want this function
to give something back to you in the form

1061
01:19:38,210 --> 01:19:44,070
of an integer. This works the same as if you
wanted to return a string, char, or even an

1062
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:49,460
array. You simply replace the word after public
with whatever variable you want to be returned

1063
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:51,330
by the function.
