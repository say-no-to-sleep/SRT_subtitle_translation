that it can take the form of many different

1388
01:45:57,230 --> 01:46:01,470

1389
01:46:01,470 --> 01:46:04,800
for planning out their code, and since there
are probably hundreds of different methods

1390
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:10,180
of writing pseudocode that are out there,
today Iâ€™d like to focus on 3 popular ones

1391
01:46:10,180 --> 01:46:13,320
that I think you might find to be extremely
