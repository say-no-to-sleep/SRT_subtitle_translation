To better understand these functions, let’s
discuss the basics of how we go about programming

1284
01:37:10,090 --> 01:37:12,890
one of these recursive functions and create
one ourselves. A really good easy example

1285
01:37:12,890 --> 01:37:17,781
of a recursive function is one which sums
all numbers from 1 to n, so let’s make a

1286
01:37:17,781 --> 01:37:21,930
recursive function that does just that. The
first thing we need is the actual function,

1287
01:37:21,930 --> 01:37:26,750
and we’re going to make it an integer function
which takes in an integer n as an argument.
