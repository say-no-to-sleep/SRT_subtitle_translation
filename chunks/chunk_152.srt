Seems pretty simple right? WRONG, because

705
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:23,190
instead of putting in the Office, you put
in FRIENDS on blu ray. No michael, no inappropriate

706
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:26,260
joke, meaning your friend would be sitting
there for the rest of his life probably confused

707
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:28,380
as to why Dunder Mifflin looks so much like
a coffee shop. This is essentially what happens

708
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:32,440
with the computer, you give it some condition
that it has to complete before the program

709
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:38,520
can terminate; however, you give it no feasible
way to finish that task. This puts the computer

710
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:42,820
in error mode and most likely will crash your
program, as the computer desperately tries

711
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:48,170
to complete the condition you gave it. As
a computer example, if we try to have a program

712
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:56,520
terminate when an integer i is no longer greater
than 99, but i is initially 100 and only increases,

713
00:52:56,520 --> 00:53:01,580
the loop will never terminate and the program
will crash. To avoid these, you generally

714
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:05,770
want to think through the flow of your code
before running it -especially with loops-

715
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:10,140
to make sure that all of your statements can
be completed by the computer. Carefully planning

716
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:14,710
out your code before you begin writing it
is an extremely useful practice, and something

717
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:18,000
weâ€™ll be covering towards the later part
of this video.
