The first type of search we’ll be talking
about is called a linear search and you’ve

1209
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:05,180
honestly probably used this multiple times
throughout your life. Every time you have

01:31:05,180 --> 01:31:09,160

you probably follow the same pattern. You

start at the top, check to see if the first
name on the list is yours, if it is. Great.
