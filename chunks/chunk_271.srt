Alright cool, now that we have a little background
on recursion, letâ€™s talk about why it works

1327
01:41:13,980 --> 01:41:19,780
so well. Now to understand why and how recursion
works, we must first understand what a stack

1328
01:41:19,780 --> 01:41:24,980
is. A stack is a data structure that contains
all of the tasks you instruct your program

1329
01:41:24,980 --> 01:41:29,710
to complete. Based on a certain method, your
program will then carry out the tasks you

1330
01:41:29,710 --> 01:41:30,710
give it.
