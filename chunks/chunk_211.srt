A library is simply a collection of functions
that all have the same theme. It may be a

951
01:10:51,670 --> 01:10:56,920

which translates text, or anything that you

01:10:56,920 --> 01:11:01,480
can think of really. There is such a variety
of libraries for any given language that most

953
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:06,090

01:11:06,090 --> 01:11:11,650
library. In fact, a good portion of any programmer's
job is looking online for packages which can

01:11:11,650 --> 01:11:17,770
make his or her job easier instead of handwriting
functions. Now, I can hear you saying, “Wow,

that’s sick, how do I do it?” Well, it’s
quite simple: an import statement.
