324
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:10,929
Now, why are variables so useful? Well, being
able to store information in a format that

325
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:15,510
can be easily referenced later is essential
for any good program. Oftentimes in code you’re

326
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:19,450
going to want to keep track of things such
as a user’s name or score, and so by creating

327
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:23,019
a variable called “name” or “score”
you can store this information in that variable

328
00:24:23,019 --> 00:24:27,250
and then reference it, add to it, or modify
it. Also, many times, the program will have

329
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:31,190
to take input from the user, which cannot
be pre programmed into the code, and thus

330
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:35,200
a variable is required to store the information.
