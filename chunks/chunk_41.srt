It is important to note that the print statement
varies depending on the programming language

185
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:42,320
being used. For example, in Java there are
multiple versions of the print statement depending

186
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,770
upon whether you would like a line break after
the printed text, and specialized print statements

187
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:51,430
which make your code more efficient. Also,
the general syntax of using a print statement

188
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:55,880
and certain nuances of its function can change
between languages. However, you can generally

189
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:00,490
rely on it carrying out the same overall function,
as it is a foundational statement for programming

190
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,040
in general. So print statements, they print
information out to the console for the developer

191
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,040
to use, nice.
