To kick things off, let’s talk about syntax
errors. These are usually the easiest of the

681
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:31,960
3 to solve since they are oftentimes something
that can be fixed within seconds. If you remember

682
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:35,980
back to earlier in the video when we talked
about syntax and programming rules, we said

683
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:39,550
that if you were to break the programming
rules, or syntax, that it would result in

684
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:44,160
an error. Well that’s what syntax errors
are, parts in your program where you fail

685
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:48,850
to meet the programming rules and so the computer
doesn’t know how to interpret your code.
