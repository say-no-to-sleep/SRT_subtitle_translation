An integer, or int for short, is as simple

293
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:51,539
as it sounds: a variable that can store an
integer value. This includes all whole numbers

294
00:21:51,539 --> 00:22:04,090
from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,648. Now
notice how I said whole numbers, integer variables

295
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:09,869
CAN not and WILL not hold any decimal values,
so keep that in mind when using variables.
