988
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:51,290
So at this point we’ve talked about both
what functions are and how we can get some

989
01:13:51,290 --> 01:13:55,040
very useful functions by importing functions
through packages. But there are definitely

990
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:58,340
going to be moments in your programming journey
where you’re going to want to make your

991
01:13:58,340 --> 01:14:04,440
own functions because you want to make one
specific to your program and code. Luckily,

992
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:08,570
making your own functions is extremely simple,
there are just some basic rules I want to

993
01:14:08,570 --> 01:14:14,440
cover. Now while we’ve previously used making
functions as an example for other topics such

994
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:18,830
as the playerStats function from a little
bit ago, they were extremely abstract and

995
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:23,070
didn’t go in depth into what is needed for
an actual function to operate. So right now

996
01:14:23,070 --> 01:14:26,860
we’re going to be covering a skeletal system
of everything that needs to be included in

997
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:30,190
a function to get it to work.
