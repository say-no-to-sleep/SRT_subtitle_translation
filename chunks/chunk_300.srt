1451
01:50:56,010 --> 01:51:01,530
But what kind of program? I can hear you asking
me. And the answer is truly whatever you want,

1452
01:51:01,530 --> 01:51:05,370
really. As I’m sure you know by now, you
can program just about anything that you have

1453
01:51:05,370 --> 01:51:10,530
on your mind, anything from simple games to
complex software. We’ve equipped you with

1454
01:51:10,530 --> 01:51:15,370
the basics that are going to be used in pretty
much any program you do decide to write. But

1455
01:51:15,370 --> 01:51:20,360
that doesn’t mean every programming language
is perfect for every application. Each language

1456
01:51:20,360 --> 01:51:25,050
has its own strengths and weaknesses, and
choosing the right one is very important for

1457
01:51:25,050 --> 01:51:30,321
making it easier, or sometimes even just possible,
for you to program what you want. So that’s

1458
01:51:30,321 --> 01:51:34,739
what we are going to talk about now: choosing
the best language for what you want to accomplish.
