This can be because you want to store information

356
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:37,509
in it later down the road, or if you’re
going to use it to store information given

357
00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:41,610
to you by the user, in which case you CAN’T
give it information since you don’t know

358
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:47,570
what the user will input. Just note that if
you try to reference, or point, to a variable

359
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:52,280
which does not have any information in it,
you’ll get what’s known as a NullPointerException,

360
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,640
which despite being an awesome name for a
YouTube channel, is something you generally

361
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,760
want to avoid when programming.
