your phone, you see the console in none of

198
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:30,810

the console to give yourself information about

199
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:34,370
how your program is performing, don’t try
to implement it in the final product because

200
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:38,900
it fundamentally just isn’t meant for that.
