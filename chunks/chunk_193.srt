For example, let’s say you were making a

882
01:05:25,870 --> 01:05:30,380
text based RPG game and one of the options
you give your player is the ability to view

883
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:35,260
their stats at various points throughout the
game. Now every time you come upon an option

884
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:39,660
and they choose the “View Stats” button,
you don’t want to have to type out 6 different

885
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:43,520
print statements for every statistic they
may have, your code would get cluttered and

886
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:49,210
messy very quickly. Instead, what you could
do is package the 6 different print statements

887
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:54,150
in a simple function called printStats().
