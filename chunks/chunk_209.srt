Sure, you could grow your own trees, chop
down your own wood, make your own tools and

941
01:10:09,390 --> 01:10:13,730
nails, and build it up from scratch. But why
do that, when you can simply go to your local

942
01:10:13,730 --> 01:10:17,760
Home Depot and buy these materials that others
have already made ready for you. Thatâ€™s

943
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:22,171
the main idea behind importing functions into
your code. Importing functions allows you

944
01:10:22,171 --> 01:10:26,750
to gain access to libraries of functions that
other people have already made for you. This

945
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:31,380
is just as useful as it sounds. There are
so many functions that are super useful for

946
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:36,350
any given program that it would take you forever
to write them all yourself. Luckily, other

947
01:10:36,350 --> 01:10:38,920
people have already done most of this for
you.
