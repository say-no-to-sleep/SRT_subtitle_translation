If you were to not follow this nomenclature
and you refer to the last element in this

549
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:09,711
array as the 10th, you get what is referred
to as an “out of bounds” error, since

550
00:41:09,711 --> 00:41:13,790
you are trying to reference the 10th element,
but there is no 10th element. What you’re

551
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:16,850
actually trying to do is reference the 9th.
