00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:26,740
The next two types of variables are floats
and doubles. Both of these variable types

300
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,679
are floating point data types, which essentially
means that these variables can store numbers

301
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:36,299
with decimal places. Whereas integer values
cannot hold decimal values, floats and doubles

302
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:40,760
can. The main difference between the two is
that a float variable can store numbers of

303
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:45,730
a precision up to 32 bit, while double can
store numbers with precision up to 64-bit.
