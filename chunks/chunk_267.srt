1310
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:32,960
We don’t KNOW what the returning value of
recursiveSum with an n of 2 is so we have

1311
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:40,100
to go through the function again, only this
time n is 2.Again n is not less than or equal

1312
01:39:40,100 --> 01:39:46,300
to 1, and so this function will go into the
else statement and return…2 plus ANOTHER

1313
01:39:46,300 --> 01:39:53,000
recursive statement, in this case the returning
value of recursiveSum with an n of 1. So once

1314
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:57,420
again we have to go through the recursiveSum
function to get the value that will be added

1315
01:39:57,420 --> 01:40:04,400
to 2 and then returned and added to 3 and
then returned. Hang in there we’re close.
