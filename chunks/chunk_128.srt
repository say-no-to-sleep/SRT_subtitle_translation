So a number in the position (0,2) would be

587
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:10,690
in the first row three columns down, in this
case the name Clint. A number in the position

588
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:16,950
(1,1) would be two rows down and 2 columns
across, in this case the name Chris. You get

589
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:22,000
the idea. Now you can also make 3-dimensional
arrays by putting an array inside an array

590
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,190
inside an array, but that's a little above
what we’re going to be covering so I’m

591
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:26,690
gonna cut it off there.
