Another important thing to note is the difference
between “4” in quotation marks and 4 without

269
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:09,389
quotation marks. Now “4” in quotation
marks is treated as a string rather than a

270
00:20:09,389 --> 00:20:14,530
4 without quotation marks which is treated
as a number. This may not seem like a big

271
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:19,230
deal, but again computers are dumb, and if
you try to do math with a number in quotation

272
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:23,149
marks it will return an error, because the
computer doesn’t understand that you’re

273
00:20:23,149 --> 00:20:27,190
trying to preform the operation on a number,
and it thinks you’re trying to add an integer

274
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:33,350
to a string, which is a big no-no in programming.
