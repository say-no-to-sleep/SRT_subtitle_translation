A base case is simply a definite value which
all recursive statements, the ones that are

1290
01:37:35,861 --> 01:37:40,410
being repeatedly called as we go through the
function, try to get towards. At the beginning

1291
01:37:40,410 --> 01:37:44,030
of the function, we test the value that was
passed in by the argument against the base

1292
01:37:44,030 --> 01:37:48,570
case to see if it is satisfied. Usually, these
base cases are some requirements, like if

1293
01:37:48,570 --> 01:37:53,440
n, as I described before, reaches a certain
value or is equal to a certain value.
