There are many different programming languages
out there that each have their own unique

68
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:12,490
uses. Languages such as Python and Java act
as general purpose languages that can perform

69
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:18,960
a variety of computational tasks, while RobotC
or HTML/CSS are languages designed for more

70
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,169
specific purposes such as moving a robot or
constructing a website. Languages can also

71
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:29,250
vary in how powerful they are. For instance,
JavaScript is a scripting language that is

72
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:34,560
designed for smaller tasks while java or python
can carry out much more computationally taxing

73
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
processes.
