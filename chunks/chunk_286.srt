The first of these are known as flowcharts,
and mainly they can be used to think through

1393
01:46:17,239 --> 01:46:22,719
the process of a particular function. A flowchart
is fundamentally a graphical representation

1394
01:46:22,719 --> 01:46:28,020
of a function and how it might flow. Many
programmers do this, and lay out the conditional

1395
01:46:28,020 --> 01:46:32,010
statements and loops they want as different
blocks in the flow chart, connected by arrows

1396
01:46:32,010 --> 01:46:36,750
and charting out every path of their function.
