01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:52,739
Now when we talk about dictionaries, we’re
not referencing that thick book you probably

1128
01:24:52,739 --> 01:24:57,739
have lying around your house which has thousands
of definitions. In computer science, dictionaries

1129
01:24:57,739 --> 01:25:02,340
are like arrays, in that they store multiple
values, however their values are stored very

1130
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:06,360
differently. Rather than being referenced
by their position within the dictionary linearly,

1131
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:10,981
each value is tied to another value that is
used to reference it, or its “key”. Because

1132
01:25:10,981 --> 01:25:15,250
of this, we need to throw away all conceptions
of dictionaries as a linear way of looking

1133
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:21,469
at data, since in actuality it is much more
fluid and interchanging. Basically, we say

1134
01:25:21,469 --> 01:25:26,590
that each position in a dictionary holds a
key/value pair. When referencing a value in

1135
01:25:26,590 --> 01:25:31,190
a dictionary, you will use it’s unique key,
and the dictionary will tell you the value

1136
01:25:31,190 --> 01:25:36,060
that is tied to it. Think of it like this,
each time you add an item to your dictionary,

1137
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:40,870
your computer creates a handcrafted box to
store the data, and also custom-makes a jeweled

1138
01:25:40,870 --> 01:25:46,390
key, one of a kind, no other like it in the
world. This way, there is only one key that

1139
01:25:46,390 --> 01:25:51,550
goes to the box that stores a certain bit
of information. Because each key must be unique,

1140
01:25:51,550 --> 01:25:55,430
reusing a key in a dictionary will result
in an error being thrown because having two

1141
01:25:55,430 --> 01:26:00,739
keys that are exactly the same would confuse
the computer as to what box, or bit of information,

1142
01:26:00,739 --> 01:26:05,860
that key leads to. However, you can store
the same value in multiple key/value pairs,

1143
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:08,400
since the keys would all be different.
