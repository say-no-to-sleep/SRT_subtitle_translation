When programming a game, for instance, a while
loop would be used to iterate through your

657
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:54,710
code, continually refreshing the screen as
the game runs. From there you could perform

658
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:58,100
operations on the screen to make the game
playable. Creating an infinite while loop

659
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:02,770
would simply be done using the syntax while(true),
as the condition true will always be evaluated

660
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:03,920
as true.
