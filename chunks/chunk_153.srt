The final type of error that we will be covering
is a logic error. This error is also pretty

719
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:27,200
self-explanatory. A logic error occurs when
the code runs smoothly without any runtime

720
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:32,220
or syntax errors, but the result that you
get isnâ€™t what you wanted. For example,

721
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:35,850
letâ€™s say you had a calculator app, and
you wanted to instruct the program to add

722
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:40,170
two numbers, except it multiplied them instead
because you used the multiplication symbol

723
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:47,840
on accident. This leads the sum to be 36 instead
of 13. Nothing went wrong with the code syntax

724
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:53,870
or runtime wise, the code runs just fine,
it just doesn't work as you intended it to.
