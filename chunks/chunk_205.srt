01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:50,839
Finally, I’d like to talk about one of the
major benefits of functions, which is that

924
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:55,000
it makes it super useful to make large changes
to your code without having to go through

925
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:01,859
the entire program. Each function call is
just a copy of that function's original code,

926
01:09:01,859 --> 01:09:06,259
and so it’s very easy to make changes to
the function and have it translate to across

927
01:09:06,259 --> 01:09:11,380
your code. Let’s go back to our printStats()
function and say that you wanted to go back

928
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:17,690
and add in a new stat that the player can
level up through experience in the game. Without

929
01:09:17,690 --> 01:09:21,290
functions, you would have to go back into
your code, find every instance that you had

930
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:26,150
printed out the users stats, and create another
print statement to display the new statistic.
