00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,789
So through these IDE’s we are finally able
to write and compile code smoothly without

110
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:16,719
worrying about the computer not being able
to understand it. The next problem we run

111
00:08:16,719 --> 00:08:21,099
into then becomes how do we write this code
in the IDE, because it’s not like we can

112
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:25,129
just type random words from a certain programming
language and expect the compiler to understand

113
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:29,740
it. This is where a programming language’s
syntax comes into play.
