This video is meant for those who are interested

21
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,340
in computer science and programming but have
no idea where to start and have little to

22
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,720
no background information on coding, and so
if that sounds like you, then strap Sean and

23
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,590
I work our way through the wacky world of
computer science, starting with the biggest

24
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:37,690
question probably on your mind, which is what
even is programming?

25
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:43,450
Well, the dictionary defines it as the process
of preparing an instructional program for

26
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:50,070
a device, but thatâ€™s a really confusing
definition, so in laymanâ€™s terms what exactly

27
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,909
does that mean? Essentially, it is attempting
to get a computer to complete a specific task

28
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:57,850
without making mistakes.
