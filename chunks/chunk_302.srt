Higher level programming languages have a

1461
01:51:45,239 --> 01:51:49,989
high level of abstraction from machine language,
that series of 0’s and 1’s from way back

1462
01:51:49,989 --> 01:51:55,370
when, while lower level programming languages
have a low level of abstraction from machine

1463
01:51:55,370 --> 01:52:00,070
language. For example, block programming where
you drag and drop programming statements together

1464
01:52:00,070 --> 01:52:05,590
like 2d legos would be a high level language,
as it does not take a high level of understanding

1465
01:52:05,590 --> 01:52:11,130
of the inner workings of a computer to program
it. The theoretical highest level of a programming

1466
01:52:11,130 --> 01:52:15,570
language would be if I could just write down
what I wanted the computer to do in simple

1467
01:52:15,570 --> 01:52:21,800
english and it would just work. But, sadly,
that doesn’t exist yet. On the other side

1468
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:26,469
of the spectrum, the lowest level programming
language would be just feeding 0’s and 1’s

1469
01:52:26,469 --> 01:52:32,020
into the computer at supersonic speed, which
would be almost impossible and extremely absurd.
