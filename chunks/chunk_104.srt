00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:47,280
Now switch statements are different since
instead of using brackets, they use a colon

489
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,740
to signify the start of a set of instructions,
and a break statement to end it. This is very

490
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:55,460
useful because you are able to essentially
use many if and else if statements without

491
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:59,280
having to write nearly as much. In switch
statements, you just always have to remember

492
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,340
to include a default case at the bottom of
the expression to denote any and all cases

493
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:06,990
that donâ€™t meet the above requirements.
