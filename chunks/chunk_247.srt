1161
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:23,940
of other ways to store data, and each boast
certain advantages over one another. We already

1162
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:28,420
covered the basics of 3, but since there are
so many, we don’t have time to go in-depth

1163
01:27:28,420 --> 01:27:32,330
into each and every one of them, and so in
order to help you grasp the basics of storing

1164
01:27:32,330 --> 01:27:35,550
information, we’re now going to talk about
one of the most important functions needed
