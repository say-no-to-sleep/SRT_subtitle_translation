Letâ€™s start with the most important question:
what exactly does recursion mean? In programming,

1276
01:36:36,750 --> 01:36:41,130
recursion refers to functions that repeatedly
call themselves. Meaning, that in the instructions

1277
01:36:41,130 --> 01:36:45,469
that occur within a function, one of the instructions
will be a call to that same function youâ€™re

1278
01:36:45,469 --> 01:36:50,620
already in.In the extremely primitive example
on your screen now, you can see we have some

1279
01:36:50,620 --> 01:36:55,560
function which, in the confines of itself,
calls itself. A recursive function will usually

1280
01:36:55,560 --> 01:37:00,770
take into account some integer as an argument,
and will use this to carry out some instructions,

1281
01:37:00,770 --> 01:37:04,469
modifying the integer that was entered, before
calling itself again with that new integer

1282
01:37:04,469 --> 01:37:05,840
as its argument.
