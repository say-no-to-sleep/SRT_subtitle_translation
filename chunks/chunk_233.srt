The final type of function is one that returns
variables and also takes in arguments, and

1084
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:28,390
for these all you need to do is combine what
we’ve learned from the previous cases. First,

1085
01:21:28,390 --> 01:21:33,770
you assign your arguments in between the parenthesis,
making sure you have also defined what variable

1086
01:21:33,770 --> 01:21:38,960
you want to return, and then ensure that no
matter what path the code takes that you are

1087
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:44,271
always returning that variable type. That
concludes our discussion on functions. As

1088
01:21:44,271 --> 01:21:48,770
you can probably tell, functions are an extremely
vast subject area and require a little bit

1089
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:53,630
of practice to fully understand, which is
why later on we’ll recommend some websites

1090
01:21:53,630 --> 01:21:58,790
you can use to practice these more difficult
topics.
