Typically searching algorithms are used to
return the index of a particular data point

1178
01:28:36,910 --> 01:28:42,280
so that it can be used, modified, updated
or checked on. For example, if you are about

1179
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:46,910
to check into a hospital run on an array system
for patients, the staff must search for your

1180
01:28:46,910 --> 01:28:51,070
name in the database and by returning the
index of where your name is, they now have

1181
01:28:51,070 --> 01:28:56,050
a quantifiable number that they can use to
easily check you in, rent out prescriptions,

1182
01:28:56,050 --> 01:29:00,510
schedule you for checkups, update your personal
information, etc. without having to search

1183
01:29:00,510 --> 01:29:03,900
through the list for your name every time.
