The linear search is great; however, since
it can work with both sorted and unsorted

1226
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:25,100
lists, because of the fact that it will eventually
cover every element in the list. The other

1227
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:29,130
search we’ll cover requires the list to
be sorted which may seem like a drawback,

1228
01:32:29,130 --> 01:32:33,210
but having a sorted list allows you to use
algorithms that are far more efficient than

1229
01:32:33,210 --> 01:32:37,631
the linear search. So overall, the linear
search is a good basic searching algorithm

1230
01:32:37,631 --> 01:32:42,040
for if you have an unsorted list, but if your
list is sorted, there are way more efficient

1231
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:47,330
options out there for you, such as the binary
search which we’ll be talking about now.
