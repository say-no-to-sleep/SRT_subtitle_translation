Imagine this, for example: you want your less-than-intelligent
friend to build a lego set, except he has

30
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:11,560
lost the instructions and can only build based
on your command. Remember though, your friend

31
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,250
is far from competent, and so If they are
not given very specific instructions on how

32
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:22,010
to build the set, there are many mistakes
he could make. If he thinks like a computer,

33
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:25,730
then if there is even one piece that you have
not told him specifically where to place and

34
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,830
how to place it, the entire lego set will
be ruined and he will be left to suffer a

35
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:35,281
complete mental breakdown causing the whole
goal of the project to be corrupted. Giving

36
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:41,450
instructions to your friend is very similar
to how programmers code. Instead of a less-than-intelligent

37
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:46,230
friend, you have a less-than-intelligent computer,
and instead of instructions on how to build

38
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,840
a lego set, we are feeding it information
on how to complete a program like a game or

39
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:56,890
web application. An important thing to note
is that comptuers are actually very dumb.
