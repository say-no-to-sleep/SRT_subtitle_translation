00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:43,879
Finally, we have char variables. Char stands
for character, and just as the name suggests,

318
00:23:43,879 --> 00:23:47,629
they can each hold one character. This is
useful when a programmer wants to read one

319
00:23:47,629 --> 00:23:51,870
button press or one character in a string
without using a string variable. A specific

320
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:55,609
example is making a game that is controlled
by the keyboard. The program needs to recognize

321
00:23:55,609 --> 00:24:00,160
the character that is pressed, and translate
that into carrying out some function. Now

322
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,799
strings can also hold one character, but charâ€™s
canâ€™t hold more than one character so keep

323
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:05,759
that in mind when defining variables.
