00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:41,110
We measure a programming language’s power,
or level, by how similar it is to machine

75
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:46,229
code, the series of 0’s and 1’s we talked
about earlier. Low-level programming languages

76
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:51,400
such as assembly or C are closer to binary
than a high-level programming language such

77
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,509
as Java or python.
