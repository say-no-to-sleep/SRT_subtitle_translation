811
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:53,700
Also, on top of saving, run your program frequently
to ensure that the current version works as

812
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:58,450
intended. This accomplishes two things. First
of all, it prevents you from saving a backup

813
00:59:58,450 --> 01:00:03,100
that doesn’t work. Secondly, if you encounter
a problem, it will be easier to find if you

814
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:07,220
have only made a small number of changes since
the last time you ran it and it worked, and

815
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:10,780
thus you will only have to look through the
new code for problems. If you’ve spent 5

816
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:14,000
hours coding and hadn’t run it during that
time period, it’s going to be extremely

817
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,731
likely that at some point during that 5 hour
code sesh you messed up, and it’s going

818
01:00:17,731 --> 01:00:21,852
to be even harder to figure out where you
went wrong. Errors, while annoying and extremely

819
01:00:21,852 --> 01:00:25,910
frustrating, are a fundamental part of making
you a better programmer.
