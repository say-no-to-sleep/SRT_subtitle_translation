Now, programming languages allow us to do
some pretty cool things with these “boxes”

363
00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:07,820
that we’ve created. For example, let’s
say we created a second variable “channelName”

364
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:12,950
and instead of setting it equal to “NullPointerException”,
we instead set it equal to our already created

365
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:18,230
“Name” variable. This doesn’t create
a space in memory for this new variable; however,

366
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:23,320
it simply points to the same location of memory
we have already created for the “Name”

367
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:27,929
variable. Going back to our storage facility
example, this would like if instead of creating

368
00:27:27,929 --> 00:27:31,799
a whole new box labeled “channelName”
and storing a sheet of paper with the word

369
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:37,759
“NullPointerException” on it, we instead
simply added another label below the “Name”

370
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:43,109
box, entitled “channelName”. Now, we have
two variables but both point towards the same

371
00:27:43,109 --> 00:27:48,729
contents, that being the string “NullPointerException”.
