Now as we wind down our introduction to programming
series, we want to take some time and go over

1359
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:51,440
some of the soft skills needed to be a successful
computer scientist since itâ€™s not all about

1360
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:56,220
writing code. In fact, many professional computer
scientists will tell you that the majority

1361
01:43:56,220 --> 01:44:01,220
of their job is spent thinking about code
rather than actually writing it. This is because

1362
01:44:01,220 --> 01:44:06,480
much of programming boils down to problem
solving. How do we optimize this system, how

1363
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:10,370
can we make this feature for our app? What
type of movement do we want for our game and

1364
01:44:10,370 --> 01:44:12,130
how can we program it?

1365
01:44:12,130 --> 01:44:15,980
The harsh truth is that no good program has
ever been written simply from the programmer

1366
01:44:15,980 --> 01:44:21,199
getting the prompt or idea, sitting down,
hopping on an IDE, and starting to write code.
