965
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:04,110
Now if you don’t know what specific classes
you’re going to want to pull methods from,

966
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:08,710
you can use a star * to import all classes
within the package you’d like. However,

967
01:12:08,710 --> 01:12:12,700
it can be beneficial to be more specific,
and only import the classes you would like,

968
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:18,380
as it helps with efficiency of the program
in the long run. For instance, in python,

969
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:24,140
the syntax to import a library is import followed
by the library name. However, importing an

970
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:31,060
entire library is more computationally taxing
than importing specific functions from a library.
