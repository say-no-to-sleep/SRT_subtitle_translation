Modulus allows us to get the remainder of

221
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:14,250
a divisional operation. For example, when
we take 10 modulus 3, we are essentially telling

222
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:19,730
the computer to take 10, divide it by 3, ignore
the actual answer and just give us the remainder

223
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:25,430
of that operation in this case 1, since when
we divide 10 by 3, the answer is 3 remainder

224
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:32,250
1. The 1 in this case is what gets printed
out to the console. If there is no remainder,

225
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:37,410
say in the case that we take 50 modulus 2,
since the remainder is 0, the function would

226
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:41,100
return 0 if we were to print it out.
