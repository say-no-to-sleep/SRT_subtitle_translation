1544
01:58:04,989 --> 01:58:10,270
classes in your high school. AP Computer Science
Principles and AP Computer Science A are both

1545
01:58:10,270 --> 01:58:15,340
amazing courses which will help you greatly
in the future, and are also incredibly informative

1546
01:58:15,340 --> 01:58:20,340

also offer other classes in the field of computer

1547
01:58:20,340 --> 01:58:25,910

game design, and data science. Any and all

1548
01:58:25,910 --> 01:58:30,140
