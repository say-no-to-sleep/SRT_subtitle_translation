1317
01:40:12,219 --> 01:40:18,660
Now we take that n, which is 1, and that is
what gets added to 2 in the previous function

1318
01:40:18,660 --> 01:40:25,390
call and then returned, so this would return
3. Now this 3 is what gets added to the first

1319
01:40:25,390 --> 01:40:33,160
function call, which is three, and so it becomes
three plus three which is 6. And FINALLY after

1320
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:38,240
all that time, we get 6 returned from the
function. Which, if youâ€™ve been following

1321
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:45,699
along at home, 3 + 2 + 1 is indeed 6. Now
this may seem like a waste of time since 1

1322
01:40:45,699 --> 01:40:51,469
+ 2 +3 is not a hard operation. But to those
of you saying that I ask you to please give

1323
01:40:51,469 --> 01:40:58,300
me the sum of all numbers from 1 to 3,567.
