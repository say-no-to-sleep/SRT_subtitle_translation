00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:29,681
Once again because this is extremely important
to remember, this means that once an array

566
00:42:29,681 --> 00:42:34,540
has been defined, there is NO WAY to change
the size of it. If you have an array titled

567
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:39,010
“Names” with a size of 8, and you try
to add another name to the array you will

568
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:43,810
receive an error, so be careful when messing
around with array sizes. Of course, you can

569
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:48,110
always go back at the start of the code when
you initially MAKE the array and allocate

570
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:54,340
more space to it if you find out you need
more space to hold items, but once it’s

571
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:59,070
defined, you CANNOT change its size.
