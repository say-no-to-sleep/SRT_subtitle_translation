Don’t necessarily think about what programming

1408
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:34,250
statements and functions you want to use,
just jot down, from start to finish, what

1409
01:47:34,250 --> 01:47:39,440
it is the program you are writing is going
to do step by step. For example, let’s say

1410
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:43,930
you’re making an app that takes in two numbers
and divides them. The pseudocode for that

1411
01:47:43,930 --> 01:47:48,550
would look a little something like this. First
I want to prompt the user to enter a number,

1412
01:47:48,550 --> 01:47:54,070
then I want to wait for the user to input
the first number. After I get the first number,

1413
01:47:54,070 --> 01:47:59,030
I want to again prompt the user to input a
second number. Once they do, I complete the

1414
01:47:59,030 --> 01:48:04,691
operation by dividing the two numbers entered
and return the result back to the user. This

1415
01:48:04,691 --> 01:48:08,041
all seems like it would be common sense, but
remember that oftentimes we’re not going

1416
01:48:08,041 --> 01:48:14,560
to be working with simple multiplication functions,
we may be working with full-scale games, algorithms,

1417
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:20,160
or user interfaces with many different options.
