This method allows you the programmer to not

1418
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:24,450
get bogged down with the syntax and conventions
you have to follow, youâ€™re simply making

1419
01:48:24,450 --> 01:48:28,590
a note of what the program's ultimate goal
should be, as if you were explaining it to

1420
01:48:28,590 --> 01:48:32,699
a friend of yours. This method really lets
you plan out everything that needs to happen

1421
01:48:32,699 --> 01:48:37,550
in your program in order for it to run smoothly.
