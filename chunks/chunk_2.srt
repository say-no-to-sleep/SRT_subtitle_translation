Over the next 90 minutes, we’ll be taking
you through this series consisting of 21 different

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:13,599
segments that hope to cover the basics of
computer programming, which can apply to any

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,600
and all programming languages you might want
to learn. We’ll be starting with the simplest

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,930
question of what is programming, and from
there will be working our way up as we talk

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,181
about common features of computer science
such as loops and arrays. We’ll discuss

8
00:00:26,181 --> 00:00:30,859
how to read and write code, debug code you’ve
written, some strategies to help plan out

9
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:35,130
your code, and much, much more. The complete
list of topics that are going to be covered

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,549
in this lecture-style video are shown on the
screen now. Additionally, there will be time-stamps

11
00:00:39,549 --> 00:00:43,380
in the description, so feel free to skip around
if you are already proficient in some areas

12
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,780
of computer science, or just want to know
about a specific topic we will be covering.
