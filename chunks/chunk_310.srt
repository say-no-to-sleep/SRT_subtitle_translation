01:55:40,250 --> 01:55:44,449
You now have the knowledge of basic programming
which will take you far in any language you

1509
01:55:44,449 --> 01:55:49,260
decide to learn, you know some good pre-programming
pseudocode strategies to help you design your

1510
01:55:49,260 --> 01:55:53,820
code from the ground up, and you might already
have a good idea as to the type of programming

1511
01:55:53,820 --> 01:55:57,880
language you might want to start with, so
what’s the next step? How can I learn that

1512
01:55:57,880 --> 01:56:02,320
