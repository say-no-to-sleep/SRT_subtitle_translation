Finally, Iâ€™d quickly like to cover an extension
of the while loop, the do-while loop. Do-while

662
00:49:09,271 --> 00:49:12,400
loops are very similar to while loops, except
they will carry out their instructions at

663
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,210
least once, even if the condition is false,
and then will carry on like a basic while

664
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:20,740
loop. Essentially, the conditions inside the
loop will run AT LEAST once, and then if the

665
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:25,520
condition is still met they will run again
and function as a normal while loop.
