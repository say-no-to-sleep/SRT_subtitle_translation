227
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,830
This can be extremely useful in many cases,
the most obvious being if we want to determine

228
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:52,050
whether or not a certain integer is even or
odd. If we take a certain number modulus 2

229
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:57,790
and it returns 0, then we know it's even since
any even number divided by 2 will always result

230
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:02,830
in a full answer without a remainder, but
if the system returns 1, then we know that

231
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:07,400
the integer is odd. You will find yourself
using the basic math operators a lot more

232
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,569
than you think, so it's good to keep them
in mind when writing your programs.
