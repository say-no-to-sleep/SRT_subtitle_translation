Examples of general purpose languages are

1491
01:54:16,210 --> 01:54:22,421
Java, C++, and Python. They each have their
own different benefits over one another. Java

1492
01:54:22,421 --> 01:54:28,300
is best at developing games and interactive
web pages, Python can act as a scripting language

1493
01:54:28,300 --> 01:54:34,170
for web programming as well as writing applications
and data analysis. And C++ is best for writing

1494
01:54:34,170 --> 01:54:39,260
applications and system programs. They all
have a variety of packages that you can import

1495
01:54:39,260 --> 01:54:43,410
and use to achieve the functionality you need
from them. While selecting the right general

1496
01:54:43,410 --> 01:54:47,440
purpose language for your big projects is
very important, for most of your programs

1497
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:52,160
any one of them will work. It really comes
down to preference. Get to know each language,

1498
01:54:52,160 --> 01:54:57,130
and decide which oneâ€™s syntax rules you
like best and find most comfortable. If you

1499
01:54:57,130 --> 01:55:01,410
get to know one general purpose language really
well and enjoy programming with it, you can

1500
01:55:01,410 --> 01:55:05,460
apply it to just about any of the programs
you plan on writing. Personally, I tend to

1501
01:55:05,460 --> 01:55:09,739
use Python for most of my projects. This is
mostly not due to any functional difference

1502
01:55:09,739 --> 01:55:14,460
between Python and any other general purpose
language, though there are a decent amount,

1503
01:55:14,460 --> 01:55:18,510
but it is mainly because I find its syntax
rules most convenient and easiest to write

1504
01:55:18,510 --> 01:55:23,950
programs with. Overall, either you can consider
the project you plan on doing, and research

1505
01:55:23,950 --> 01:55:29,469
and see which language boasts the most advantages
for your purposes, or you can simply become

1506
01:55:29,469 --> 01:55:34,580
comfortable with a language and use it for
most of the projects you decide to write.
