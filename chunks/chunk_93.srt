Now, brackets are used in most programming

431
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:42,649
languages to indicate a segment of code which
will run. It works like this, if the condition

432
00:32:42,649 --> 00:32:47,169
in parentheses is true, then all of the code
contained within the brackets will run, and

433
00:32:47,169 --> 00:32:51,809
if the condition in the parenthesis is NOT
true, then it will skip over all of the statements

434
00:32:51,809 --> 00:32:56,619
within the brackets. A quick note is that
while this is the case with most programming

435
00:32:56,619 --> 00:33:01,769
languages, some; like Python, use colons and
white space to determine where a piece of

436
00:33:01,769 --> 00:33:07,249
code starts and ends, but for the sake of
this series, weâ€™ll be using curly braces.
