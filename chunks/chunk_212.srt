In most languages, an import statement consists
of 3 parts. The library you would like to

958
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:33,130
import from, the package you would like to
import from that library, and then which class

959
01:11:33,130 --> 01:11:38,520
from that package you would like to use. For
example, we could load up the Java library,

960
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:43,560
and from there import the util package, short
for utilities, and then from that utilities

961
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:48,230
package import the scanner class, a class
which allows us to read information from the

962
01:11:48,230 --> 01:11:52,770
user. A package is simply a smaller sect of
functions and methods to help differentiate

963
01:11:52,770 --> 01:11:57,730
between the thousands of methods contained
in a library, and class is even more specialized

964
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,380
than that.
