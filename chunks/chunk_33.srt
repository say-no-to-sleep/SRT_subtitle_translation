148
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:10,810
Now another thing which makes IDE’s so useful
is that they will let you know if and when

149
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:15,260
there are syntax errors in your code. Syntax
errors of course being parts of your code

150
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:20,310
which do not follow the rules we talked about
previously. The IDE will tell you where in

151
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:24,600
your code the error is, and also won’t let
you run your program until the error has been

152
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,110
fixed. Because of how important syntax is
to writing code and learning a new language,

153
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,600
it's recommended that you learn the rules
and syntax of a language before beginning

154
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,450
to write complex programs in that language.
