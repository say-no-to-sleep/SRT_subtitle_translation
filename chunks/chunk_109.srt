Another example could be a program which changes

502
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,520
the color scheme depending on the time of
day. Or even more simply, if a user presses

503
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,130
a button that is meant to move on to another
screen in an app, the programmer would only

504
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:48,450
want the app to change screens if the user
clicks that button. A program without conditional

505
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:51,870
statements would do the same thing every time,
and would be very primitive compared to one

506
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:54,770
that can change depending on its conditions.
