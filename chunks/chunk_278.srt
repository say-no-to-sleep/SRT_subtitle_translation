This is the same logic that makes infinite
loops crash your program. Recursion works

1349
01:43:00,810 --> 01:43:05,570
on these same principles. The initial call
makes a second call which is added to the

1350
01:43:05,570 --> 01:43:10,670
stack, and now that one must be taken care
of first, but in that one another function

1351
01:43:10,670 --> 01:43:15,910
is called which gets added to the stack, and
so on, until you reach the base case in which

1352
01:43:15,910 --> 01:43:19,080
you slowly start going back down the stack.
